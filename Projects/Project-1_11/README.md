# Task-1 (30) (Dead Line-27th Jan)

### Task Description:

## Madan-1:
**Identify Relevant Classes:**
```
Examine the provided Book Management App codebase and 
discern the classes responsible for the specified 
features (Book Addition & Display, 
Bookshelf Management, and User Management).
```

## Shriom-2:
**Document Functionality and Behavior:**
```
 For each identified class, 
 create detailed documentation elucidating 
 its functionality and behavior in 
 the context of the corresponding subsystem.
```

## Amal-3:
**Observations and Comments:**
```
Include observations and comments in 
your documentation, highlighting points of 
strength and weakness within the system.
```

## Hanuma-4:
**Create UML Diagrams:**
```
Utilize Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, 
association,composition and aggregation to model the relationships 
and interactions between the identified classes accurately. 
Employ UML class diagrams to visually represent the structure, 
relationships, and attributes of the identified classes. 
Ensure that the level of abstraction chosen is appropriate for 
conveying a clear and concise representation of the system. 
Please note that you have to use plantUML or starUML as the tool 
for creating UML diagrams. 
Hand-drawn diagrams or diagrams 
drawn using tools such as draw.io, lucidchart etc. 
will not be considered for grading.
```
## Vilal-5:
**Assumptions:**
```
If simplifying assumptions are made during 
the documentation process, explicitly 
state these assumptions in your report.
```
**Note-1:**
```
I am also working with Hanuma to design a 
UML Class Diagram because most of 
the assumptions are relevant to 
the design part.
```
**Note-2:**
```
Here, I am adding a document 
link where we will update all the progress. 
Please update the document only 
when your work is final."
